{"films": [{"name": "The Nightmare Before Christmas", "tropes": [{"url": "http://dbtropes.org/ont/TVTItem", "comment": "Released to cinemas in 1993, this stop-motion animation film produced and conceived by Tim Burton, though actually scripted by Caroline Thompson and directed by Henry Selick (as Burton himself was busy with Batman Returns at the time), starts with the citizens of Halloween Town celebrating (you guessed it) Halloween in the grandest fashion possible, due to their love of (all right, unnerving obsession with) scaring everyone senseless. However, Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, has grown rather tired of the same old thing, and yearns for something new in his life.After the current year's celebration of Halloween, the morose Jack goes for a long walk out of town into the forest, where he happens to walk into a circle of trees he's never seen before. Each tree bears a portal which leads to another holiday town. Immediately attracted by the Christmas tree shaped one, he ventures into Christmas Town. There he discovers the wonders of the bright and jolly, and becomes obsessed with understanding Christmas.He returns to Halloween town and informs the townsfolk of Christmas, but both his and their understanding of the holiday is limited by their experience of Halloween. In a Perspective Flip of the typical Christmas Special plot of &quot;monsters try to steal Christmas,&quot; Jack has perfectly good intentions &mdash; he thinks taking over Christmas for a year will be great fun for everyone involved, both in Halloween Town and the human world, and it'll give &quot;Sandy Claws&quot; a year off for vacation once some homicidal children kidnap him and bring him to Halloween Town to sit Christmas out.The whole town groups together to create Christmas, but Sally the rag doll, who is secretly in love with Jack, has a vision that it will be a disaster. She's right, of course.Throw all that in with a boogie man fashioned from a burlap sack filled with insects, rousing musical numbers, scares a-plenty for the young ones, and some truly brilliant imagery and directing, and you get the now classic film The Nightmare Before Christmas.Starting in 2006, it's gotten a theatrical re-release once a year at Halloween time, with a somewhat disappointingly light-handed makeover into a 3-D Movie. Compare Coraline, which is from the same director. The difference likely has to do with the fact that Coraline was intended to be a 3-D film from the time it began filming. The 3-D version of The Nightmare Before Christmas was retrofitted approximately thirteen years after its original release.It has a ridiculously large and well-documented article on Wikipedia. Seriously, just look at it. It also has a fan website called the Pumpkin Patch.The series would later gain a sequel in video game form on the PlayStation 2 titled The Nightmare Before Christmas: Oogie's Revenge and a prequel, The Pumpkin King on the Game Boy Advance. Halloween Town and Jack also appear in almost every game in the Kingdom Hearts series. Disneyland has added movie-themed attractions in the Haunted Mansion just in time for Halloween in the past years.Now has a character sheet and Fan Fic Recommendations.", "name": "TVTItem"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/MindScrew", "comment": "Mind Screw: &quot;This Is Halloween&quot;.

It's something of a twist on the fable &quot;The Grasshopper And The Ants&quot; meeting The Seven Samurai with a bit of &iexcl;Three Amigos! thrown in for good measure.The movie begins in a peaceful ant colony, which yearly is terrorized by a biker gang-esque group of grasshoppers (led by the intimidating Hopper), and the ants are forced to give them an offering of food. One year, an ant named Flik (considered a nuisance by the rest of the colony due to his inventions, which often cause more trouble than they're worth) accidentally destroys the offering. Hopper forces the ants to create a replacement offering, twice as large, giving them until &quot;the last leaf falls&quot; to comply. The ants, who need that time to store food for themselves to survive the winter, fear that Hopper's demand could ruin the colony. Flik volunteers to redeem himself by recruiting &quot;tough bugs&quot; to fight Hopper and his gang. Seeing nothing more than an opportunity to get Flik out of the way so he doesn't mess anything else up, the colony's ruler-to-be, Princess Atta, gives him her blessing.Flik travels to &quot;the city&quot; (a bug city underneath a trailer), where he meets a bunch of recently-fired circus bugs. After seeing them perform, he mistakes them for warriors, and takes them back to the colony. The circus bugs are initially shocked when they find out why they're there, but eventually begin to love living in the colony, and agree to help Flik come up with a plan to defeat the grasshoppers. Will this be the invention which finally succeeds? Or will Flik's usual bad luck continue, leaving the colony to face the wrath of Hopper and his gang?A Bug's Life, like most Pixar films, was a critical and financial success, and, with its Hilarious Outtakes, also started the Credits Gag tradition in Pixar movies. It did not, however, receive the universal acclaim of Toy Story. Its Rotten Tomatoes grade is the fifth-lowest of any of their films, at a rating of 92% (only Cars, Cars 2, Brave and Monsters University have lower grades). Due to this, it is not as widely remembered as their other films and is considered their most underrated.Still, 92% eh?This was Roddy McDowall's last film (and Hayden Panettiere's first).", "name": "TVTItem"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/HeroicBSOD", "comment": "Heroic BSOD: Flik before the climax.", "name": "Heroic BSOD"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/AntWar", "comment": "Ant War: Naturally.", "name": "Ant War"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/CharacterDevelopment", "comment": "Flik, whose desperation to prove himself has slowly been turning into true self-confidence, stands up against Hopper for Princess Atta the way he did for Dot at the beginning of the movie.

R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings into three films (directed by Peter Jackson) with great commercial and critical success. The movies were filmed together and released one year apart for the holiday seasons 2001-2003.One of the biggest movie projects ever undertaken, the overall budget was around $285 million and principal filming for all three films took place over 18 months in Jackson's native New Zealand. The entire project took eight years, factoring in the early pre-production and the fact that additional pick-ups were filmed in between each film's release. In fact, the very last shot filmed (a few skulls tumbling along the ground), was quickly shot in the studio after the third film was released and included in the extended edition. The trilogy was a great financial success, with the films being the 32nd, 24th, and 6th (8th, 4th, and 2nd following the third film's release) highest-grossing films of all time, respectively, unadjusted for inflation. The films were critically acclaimed, winning 17 out of 30 Academy Awards nominated in total, and received wide praise for the cast and for the innovative practical and digital special effects. Return of the King is the first (and currently only) fantasy movie to ever be awarded the Best Picture Oscar.The films were remarkably faithful in many respects, though many changes were made due to the many factors involved with adapting such a monumental work. Among the most significant changes (some of which are controversial) include the nature of Saruman's death, the characterizations of Faramir, Arwen, Denethor, and Gimli, and the removal of various subplots to make the story as a whole more appealing to movie audiences or to streamline their remarkably nuanced events from the books. Check out the Biggest Complaints page to see some of the less-popular changes.The theatrical versions were lengthy epics (the first two clocking in around 3 hours and the third 3 1/2 hours), and the &quot;Extended Editions&quot; (released before the succeeding movies) added at least another half-hour to each film's running timenote&nbsp; Around 12 minutes of that extra run time is credits added for the fan community website. Unusual for such a thing, Peter Jackson has stated that the Extended Editions are not an actual Director's Cut but merely a fan-friendly extension to enlarge the world of Middle-Earth and see what things they left out of the faster paced Theatrical Versions.An adaptation of The Hobbit is being made into a three-part prequel style story, the first part of which was released in winter 2012.

Peter Jackson himself invoked this in his explanation as to his complete rewrite of the meetings of Faramir and Frodo's group: in the books, he lets them go free after learning of their quest and agreeing with it; in the film, he keeps them captive in order to take The Ring. Jackson said specifically this was because after the first book, the Ring's power to corrupt became an Informed Ability until it surfaced again at the tail-end of Return; in order to remind the viewer that it was basically evil incarnate, and keep with the rules Tolkien himself set, he had to have Faramir be tempted by the Ring. The Osgiliath detour even gets a Continuity Nod: He wanted to move Shelob to the third movie because anything was going to pale next to Helm's Deep, and that left Frodo and Sam completely out of (action-y) danger for the entire movie. There had to be a threat, and poor Faramir got drafted. When Tolkien commented on ideas for a film version by Forest J. Ackerman, he said they should probably skip the Hornburg entirely so that the Ents' attack on Isengard as well as the final battle would look that much more impressive. (We&rsquo;re all glad the filmmakers didn&rsquo;t take him up on that.) Postponing his acquisition of And&uacute;ril to the third film gave Aragorn greater credibility as a ranger earlier on, as he got to demonstrate his knife skills more. Having him leave Narsil's shards in Rivendell also avoided the visible incongruity of a trained survivalist, who needs to travel light, hauling a priceless historical artifact all over the wilderness with him. In the books, there's a lot of random elves who show up, do one incredibly plot-crucial thing, and are never seen again. Most of their jobs went to Arwen, so she'd have something to do to make the audience actually give a damn about her. Elrond got the rest. And then later completely turned on its head when Arwen was to be added to the Battle of the Hornburg before Peter Jackson decided it would be too much, which led to another elf getting a one-off: Haldir.

Later used for the Three Hunters, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Notable in that, according to the composer Howard Shore, it never quite makes a full reappearance after the events in Moria; at least one note is off, or the rhythm is changed. The &quot;Hobbit theme,&quot; a sort of jaunty flute piece with bassoons and oboes evoking pastoral countryside. Plays over the &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; narration. Gets more and more wistful the more the hobbits, especially Frodo, go through Break the Cutie - only to be restored to full brass-filled glory when everyone bows to the hobbits during Aragorn's coronation. The &quot;Rohan Theme.&quot; Wistful when we first hear it on the Norwegian fiddle when the heroes arrive at Edoras, it later appears in full-on brass mode for Helm's Deep. Plays over the charge of the Rohirrim at the Battle of Pelennor Fields, with Norwegian fiddle and brass sections working together. The &quot;Gondor Theme.&quot; Majestic, soaring theme that wouldn't sound entirely out of place in a pirate movie. Heard as Gandalf and Pippin arrive at Minas Tirith and gallop up the city to see Denethor, as well as over the lighting of the beacons. An early version of this theme is played on solo French horn as Boromir speaks at the Council of Elrond. The &quot;Minas Tirith Theme&quot;, first heard in an Extended scene in Fellowship when Boromir and Aragorn talk in Lothl&oacute;rien unintentionally become the &quot;And&uacute;ril Theme&quot; and associated with Aragorn's march to kingship. It seems it originally was never meant to be associated with And&uacute;ril, but Howard Shore changed his mind. The &quot;Mordor Theme.&quot; Dark and dramatic with lots of brass and ominous chanting when needed. Heard as Gandalf witnesses the arrival of the Nazg&ucirc;l. Used to excellent effect first as a threatening sound when Sauron first appears before the Allied Army, single-handedly stopping their attack with his very presence, and then blasting into angry brass and choir as he sweeps away scores of soldiers with casual swings of his mace. There's another &quot;Mordor Theme&quot; as well, which is a dissonant, menacing melody, often featuring an instrument called a rhaita, which gives the theme a slightly Middle-Eastern feel. It is featured at its most ominous during the siege of Gondor, as the giant battering ram, Grond, breaks through the gates. When the ring is destroyed and Sauron's tower is falling, the melody reappears one last time, but the dissonance is triumphantly resolved. &quot;Gollum's Theme,&quot; appears all the way through the second film whenever Gollum is around, but most notably as a song in the end credits sung by Emiliana Torrini. The &quot;Isengard Theme,&quot; played with heavy brass and percussion in the Caverns of Isengard or when the Uruk-hai are on the move. Unlike other themes, which are in more conventional timing, Isengard's theme is done in 5/4 time, which sounds a little bit off or unnatural (as most music these days is done in 4/4, 2/4, or 3/4 time), to reflect the twisting of nature and industrial methods of Saruman. The percussion in question is actually banging an opened piano's wires with chains. The theme for the elves, or at least Galadriel's elves, is first heard as an ethereal, dreamy piece with generous amounts of Cherubic Choir and One-Woman Wail. In the second movie, though, it gets transformed into a badass military march during the scene where the elven army comes to the rescue at Helm's Deep. &quot;The History of the Ring,&quot; representing the power of the One Ring, especially when it changes hands or when someone tries to take it &mdash; plays under the title card of each movie, so easily mistaken for the theme to the trilogy itself &mdash; or perhaps it is, in a way. &Eacute;owyn's theme (the only theme other than Gollum's associated with one character), played usually whenever she's standing at the front of the Golden Hall. The March of the Ents/General Badassery about to Happen theme (can be heard here). There is a Moria theme, too, profoundly sad and full of grandeur, with a soft chorus of deep (Maori) voices in Khuzdul. It plays once, as the Fellowship walk through the deserted corridors of what was once a bright and majestic city under the mountain. The Theme of the Gray Havens. Introduced rather late into Return, during the most desperate moment of the siege of Gondor, when Pippin believes all is lost. Comes to its full fruition when the last of the Elves  and Frodo leave Middle-Earth from the Grey Havens. Before that, it gets its first true moment when Sam carries Frodo up Mount Doom.", "name": "Leitmotif"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/TheManInTheMirrorTalksBack", "comment": "The Man in the Mirror Talks Back: When Gollum talks to Sm&eacute;agol, it's via some variation on this mechanism.

Not that there's anything wrong with that...This 1990 film was Burton's first after the mega-success that was Batman, and with the rather free hand he was given, he decided to shoot for the moon with a serio-comic Fairy Tale. He came up with the concept and Caroline Thompson handled the screenplay.The youthful hero (Johnny Depp) is Exactly What It Says on the Tin, a sort of android. His creator, a lonely inventor (Vincent Price, in what was his final film appearance), upgraded a robot from his assembly-line machinery in his castle, until he finally almost completely resembles a human being - however, he dies just before completing his project by giving him hands. Edward is left alone with the scissor-and-shear limbs he already has. He shyly, quietly keeps to himself, passing the time by tending the garden (in particular, sculpting the bushes into whimsical images) until one day, an Avon lady comes calling. You see, while the castle and its residents are straight out of Gothic fantasy, the town at the foot of the hill it stands upon is a 1950s-60s pastel suburbia. Realizing he is friendly and mostly harmless (as he understands the dangers his blades pose) the Avon lady, Peg Boggs, compassionately decides to take him to live with her family.At first, Edward is welcomed by the community and he is quite happy to be of help to others; in particular, his talent for yard decoration progresses to dog grooming and eventually hairstyling. He's so fascinatingly alien that a local tart, Joyce, even tries to seduce him. Ironically, he falls in love with Peg's teenaged daughter Kim (Winona Ryder), one of the few who isn't immediately enamored with him. Of course, that's partially because she already has a boyfriend, the Jerk Jock Jim (Anthony Michael Hall). Jim decides to take advantage of her love for him to convince her to take advantage of Edward's innocent kindness, so he will help them commit a burglary. The consequences of this start a chain of events that lead to a most Bittersweet Ending.While only a modest success at the time, in part because of the strange premise and perhaps because Home Alone effectively commandeered the holiday movie season that year (both were 20th Century Fox releases, as it happened), it's since gained a large fanbase, and turned out to be the first of many collaborations between Burton and Depp. In 2005 it was adapted into a ballet by British choreographer Matthew Bourne.", "name": "TVTItem"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/AscendedExtra", "comment": "Ascended Extra: Esmeralda has a slightly bigger role in the ballet.

He was also an excellent husband and father. He may never have known of Edward II's proclivities, he certainly didn't kill any of his male lovers. Anyway Edward II had at least one bastard in addition to four children by Queen Isabelle (the oldest born seven years after Wallace died; see Artistic License - History below), suggesting that he swung both ways. His plan to cause the racial death of Scotland is entirely invented. Actually, many historians believe Edward II wasn't gay at all (Not That There's Anything Wrong with That), and that it was made up to discredit him. It is true that he did have several male &quot;court favourites&quot;, most infamously Hugh Despenser the Younger, but he was not necessarily in sexual relationships with them. Also, Longshanks' control over Scotland was partly the Scots' own fault, since they decided to &quot;temporarily&quot; relinquish control of Scotland to him until a new king could be appointed and didn't plan for the possibility that Longshanks would backstab them after having been handed all of Scotland on a silver platter. Amusingly, he did everything he could to secure the Scottish crown for an acceptable Scottish monarch, but the divisive Scottish noble families made it difficult appointing a satisfactory candidate, as every option seemed to lead towards civil war. When an appropriate candidate was finally found after years of negotiation (amusingly a young girl who was barely Scottish at all) that candidate died at sea as she was being transported to Scotland to take the crown.

But history is written by those who have hanged heroes.&quot; The opening narration is wrong from beginning to end: Scotland 1280 AD. I shall tell you of William Wallace. Historians from England will say I am a liar, but history is written by those who have hanged heroes. The king of Scotland had died without a son, and the king of England, a cruel pagan known as Edward the Longshanks, claimed the throne of Scotland for himself. Scotland's nobles fought him and fought each other over the crown. So Longshanks invited them to talks of truce &mdash; no weapons, one page only. Among the farmers of that shire was Malcolm Wallace, a commoner with his own lands. He had two sons &mdash; John and William. In 1280, King Alexander III of Scotland was not only still alive, but his two sons were also alive. The younger son, David, died in 1281; the elder son, Alexander, died in 1284; and finally Alexander III himself died in 1286. Alexander III left a granddaughter, Margaret, acknowledged as his heir by the Scottish nobles. Rather than fighting each other over the crown, the Scots appointed regents who ruled until she died in 1290. At this point, the nobles did not fall into civil war, and Edward did not claim the throne of Scotland. Instead, the Scots nobles asked Edward to preside (as a neutral party) over a commission to determine the rightful king. While Edward did claim overlordship of Scotland and undoubtedly influenced the conclusion, the result was to choose John Balliol as King of Scotland by the normal rules of primogeniture. At no time did Edward invite the nobles of Scotland &quot;to talks of truce &mdash; no weapons, one page only&quot;. Balliol did start a war against Edward in 1296, because he felt that Edward was being overbearing. Unfortunately for Balliol, Edward was one of the best generals ever to sit on the English throne, and beat Balliol handily. Incidentally, Edward was in no sense a &quot;pagan&quot; &mdash; there had not been any true pagans in Britain for centuries. (He wasn't even a paganus in the Classical Latin sense of &quot;peasant&quot; or &quot;yokel&quot;.) In addition, Malcolm Wallace had three sons in 1280. The one left out was the eldest, also named Malcolm. Interestingly enough, the opening narration might be acknowledging these problems with a hint of self-depreciation, given who is saying it.

The movie isn't about the actual founding fathers (ie Washington) but is instead about some of the biggest and most brutal engagements that were waged in the southern colonies, as seen through an Officer turned Farmer turned Officer again. Mel Gibson is Benjamin Martin, a veteran of the French And Indian War who was changed by the horrors he has seen (and committed). South Carolina had just voted to join the war, but Ben said he would not. His eldest son Gabriel decides to go anyway. He isn't seen again until two years later, when he staggers home, wounded and carrying dispatches between two rebel leaders.This is where Colonel Tavington comes in. The commander of the elite Green Dragoon forces, Tavington orders the deaths of the rebel wounded, has the Martins' house burned down, and takes Gabriel in as a spy to be hanged. Thomas, his next oldest son, tries to intervene, and gets a bullet in the back for his trouble. This sparks Benjamin Martin's decision to join the Revolution to fight the Redcoats (and to ambush and slaughter the British detachment).The rest of the film is spent with Martin and his militia harassing Tavington (and by extension, Cornwallis) throughout South Carolina, holding out until The French arrive to reinforce the Colonials.Nominated for three Academy Awards, the film is known for its gruesome battles and the hit-and-run tactics employed by the militia. It's also noted for its score, which Barack Obama had playing in the background during his Presidential acceptance speech.Is also known, however, for it extreme cases of Politically Correct History, having plenty of (partly blatant) Historical Villain Upgrades for the British and Historical Hero Upgrades for the rebels, to make the conflict more justified.", "name": "TVTItem"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/CallToAgriculture", "comment": "Call to Agriculture: After experiencing the horrors of the French and Indian War, Benjamin took up farming, and he refused to fight in the American Revolution, at first.", "name": "Call to Agriculture"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/RelativeButton", "comment": "Relative Button: Tavington deliberately tries to provoke Martin this way when he taunts Martin about shooting Thomas.", "name": "Relative Button"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/PyrrhicVictory", "comment": "Pyrrhic Victory: (With shades of Heroic Sacrifice and Was It Really Worth It?.)

Woody receives some competition when Andy gets a new toy for his birthday, &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot;, who thinks he's really a soldier of Star Command rather than a toy. His undoubted leadership qualities (and up-to-date modernity) arouse jealousy in Woody; when Buzz is &quot;accidentally&quot; lost, the other toys think Woody masterminded the disappearance. Hijinks ensue, and Woody and Buzz have a final confrontation that forces both of them to join forces to keep the toy &quot;family&quot; together.In 2009, Toy Story was re-released alongside Toy Story 2 as a double feature in stereoscopic Disney Digital 3-D, with the two films completely re-rendered to match the level of detail of Toy Story 3 (the UK had to wait until January 2010 for Toy Story 2 to come out in 3D).The characters will make further appearances in a series of shorts titled Toy Story Toons.

Even worse, their house has been sold to the Deetzes &mdash; an eccentric, upscale yuppie family who want to do a complete overhaul. With no clue about what to do and little-to-no real help coming from the Celestial Bureaucracy known as the afterlife, Barbara and Adam learn of a being known as Betelgeuse (pronounced, of course, &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;) who claims he can rid their house of its new owners. They release him after saying his name three times. Hilarity Ensues.This iconic Tim Burton movie remains one of the most popular comedy movies of all time. Though it contains the typical gothic imagery you'd expect from Burton, it also features memorable performances by Alec Baldwin, Geena Davis, Jeffrey Jones, Catherine O'Hara, Glenn Shadix, Winona Ryder, and Michael Keaton as the B-Man himself, as well as the musical stylings of both Danny Elfman and Harry Belafonte. Mix all of these elements together, and it's not hard to figure out why Beetlejuice soon became a staple of Halloween.Interestingly enough, Beetlejuice was originally conceived as a very serious horror film titled The Maitlands with Beetlejuice originally envisioned as a shape-shifting reptilian demon. The involvement of Tim Burton and Michael Keaton helped turn it into more of a comedy.The movie was so popular that it spawned an animated Recycled: The Series on ABC and Fox Kids. It bore little resemblance to the movie, however; the Maitlands and Juno were eliminated entirely, the title character's name was spelt &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;, he and Lydia were best friends, and the stories largely took place in Beetlejuice's home dimension of &quot;the Neitherworld&quot;.", "name": "TVTItem"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/PrecisionFStrike", "comment": "Precision F-Strike: After Betelgeuse knocks down a tree:", "name": "Precision F-Strike"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/CharacterTitle", "comment": "Character Title", "name": "Character Title"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/ExpositionDiagram", "comment": "Exposition Diagram: Charles Deetz uses a Type 1 to show what his &quot;Museum of the Paranormal&quot; will look like.", "name": "Exposition Diagram"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/TogetherInDeath", "comment": "Together in Death: A rare lighthearted approach, where Adam and Barbara Maitland are stuck as ghosts haunting their own home.

Both sides are portrayed neutrally without either getting a sympathetic point of view. This gives a different slant on a story instead of just the normal protagonist vs. antagonist story.

The T-1000 could create the outer shape of a gun but couldn't create an actual, working gun. Much like a ball of clay; the outside matches, but the inside isn't the same as what it's mimicking. Also, it is obvious in the movie that the T-1000 actually moves by morphing, not via anything resembling human structure (at one point, he&rsquo;s held with his face to the wall, and he simply morphs his back into his front; at another, the T-800 puts a fist through his head, which promptly becomes a hand holding said fist&#8202; while a 'new' head sprouts from its shoulder). Further still, at one point in the novelization, the T-1000 takes the shape of a fat policeman, it is explicitly said that he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t like the shape&rdquo;, because its larger volume forced him to assume a less dense configuration (presumably, he morphed &ldquo;bubbles&rdquo; inside himself); it explains why he repeatedly returned to the &ldquo;thin&rdquo; policeman shape: it was just right.", "name": "make a to do&nbsp;send a pm&nbsp;add to watchlist&nbsp;drop watch&nbsp;go to watchlist Shape Shifter Baggage"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/EnemyRisingBehind", "comment": "Enemy Rising Behind: When taking one of the asylum guard's places, the T-1000 copies the appearance of the guard as it rises up from the floor.

After losing his mate and all but one of their 400+ eggs in a barracuda attack, Marlin becomes overprotective of his remaining son, Nemo. On his first day of school, Nemo gets fed up with Marlin's fear of the ocean, and ends up disobeying his father's orders by going near a boat. Soon after, Nemo gets &quot;rescued&quot; by a scuba diver, and Marlin, going against all his fears, goes off to find him. Marlin joins up with a forgetful blue tang named Dory, and they brave all sorts of obstacles to, well, find Nemo.Meanwhile, the scuba diver turns out to be a Sydney dentist who puts Nemo in his office's aquarium, and plans to give the fish to his niece, Darla, for her upcoming birthday. The other fish in the tank, most of whom are somewhat insane, decide to help Nemo escape (especially because Darla is described as a &quot;fish killer&quot;, who, whenever she gets a fish, shakes their plastic bag too hard).This movie is notable for being Pixar's most commercially successful featurenote&nbsp;let alone a G-rated one until Toy Story 3, but it's still one of the highest-grossing animated movies ever made as well as the highest-selling DVD ever. It also started Disney's Oscar-winning streak and was honored with a Disney Digital 3D re-release. It didn't exactly hurt the tourism trade in Australia, either.

They prefer live prey. The interior of the whale's throat is too large. While blue whales have a gigantic mouth, their throat is tiny and unable to swallow anything larger than a beach ball. They also have respiratory and digestive traits completely separated, you know, so that they don't unintentionally sneeze fish out of their blowhole. And where is the light inside its mouth coming from? Chuckles, the gift fish who was killed by Darla, was a goldfish. Which live in freshwater. The other Tank Gang fish are saltwater fish. You can see where this is going. None of the sea turtles seem to worry about having to breathe. They also don't travel in flocks, but this was intentional, see Rule of Cool below. Sea turtles don't live anywhere near 150 years; that honor belongs to tortoises. Their expected lifespan is still quite impressive at 80 years. Clownfish do live in anemones but they also live in harems dominated by one male and one female, with a lot of non-productive males in the rest. When the dominant female dies, the dominant male undergoes a Gender Bender and becomes the new dominant female. Clownfish will also reproduce with their relatives in times of emergency. This particular tidbit has raised eyebrows at the choice of clownfish for the film. Interestingly, a featurette on DVD addresses the whole Artistic License issue.

There is also a manga adaptation that holds little similarity to the film, although the apartment building is similar.The film was remade in the United States in 2005, under the same title.The film follows Yoshimi Matsubara, who is in the midst of a messy custody battle with her (highly unpleasant) ex-husband, Kunio Hamada, over their young daughter, Ikuko. Desperate to prove herself to be a fit parent to Ikuko, she moves herself and Ikuko into their own place, which happens to be an apartment held in a run-down old building. The building is somewhat eerie, but it suits Yoshimi just fine, for the time being. However, shortly after moving in, she notices that the ceiling of their apartment has a sinister and inexplicable damp patch, which continues to expand day by day. In the midst of Yoshimi finding a new job and Ikuko starting a new school, many strange and frightening events occur, several of which involve the mysterious appearance (and subsequent re-appearances) of a child's red bag.

Though Scott didn't win the Oscar for Best Director, the film itself took home many others &mdash; including the all-important Best Picture &mdash; and earned Russell Crowe his first Oscar.This film is not to be confused with the proto-superheroic 1930 book Gladiator, the TV gameshow Gladiators, or the general trope Gladiator Games.

Lucilla was executed by Commodus (she tried to assassinate him) in 182 AD, predeceasing him by a full decade. Marcus Aurelius was eager to have Commodus take over, Commodus was strangled in his bath after a 13-year rule, and power did not transfer to the Senate after his death. In-universe, Scipio Africanus and his citizen-levy legions would have had an apoplectic fit if they seen later generations characterise them as the chariot riding, archery using, &quot;home team&quot; gladiators for the sake of historical gloss on a, to them, vulgar execution (Republican era gladiator fights of Scipio's era were generally not to the death).

The Scientist whose work was weaponized and whose subsequent falling out of favor was heavily publicized is voiced by an actor whose name is Oppenheimer. The machines are based off mythological beasts. Makes it a lot easier to describe the Seamstress as a Medusa than all the bits and pieces that make it up. When 7 kills the Cat Beast, she jumps on its back and rides it rodeo-style, before catapulting into the air and decapitating it as she falls down. This is exactly how Alice killed the Jabberwocky in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland - although since this film came out first, the reference may go the other way. Or, um, how about Clotho?

One of the pictures in My New Adventure Book shows Carl and Russell going to a movie theater to see Star Wars. The Star Wars references themselves may be Shout Outs to how Pixar was originally spun off from George Lucas' media empirenote&nbsp;and since Disney bought out the rest of that media empire, it's now Hilarious In Hindsight. The idea of a &quot;plateau lost in time&quot; somewhere in South America is clearly modeled after the legendary lost plateau from The Lost World, made particularly glaring with all the references to it describing it as a land lost to time. On top of all that, Muntz's presentation of the giant bird skeleton is similar to the scene from the book, in which Dr. Challenger presents a live pteranodon as proof of his journey (a Bronto/Apatosaurus in the original stop-motion film). Pete Docter has made no mistake that Chuck Jones is one of his heroes. Check out the shapes of the rocks during the chase sequence, the personalities of the dogs, and the fact that Kevin looks somewhat familiar... The infomercial that Carl watches in his house is a shout out to a viral internet video from failblog.com that can be found here. There's a scene where the dogs are all playing poker, in a shout out to the famous piece of pop art. In real life, Charles Muntz was one of the pioneers of television, known as &quot;Mad Man&quot; Muntz. His business model was to control every aspect of television, from programming (the Du Mont Network) to the actual sets. Although he was not able to compete for long against the established radio crossover networks of CBS and NBC, many of his innovations are still in use today. In The Art of Up, there's a detailing of all the badges on Russel's sash. There are several badges, some that look to be modeled from actual merit badges; but one that caught his eye depicted a hand karate-chopping a watermelon in half. Wilderness Explorers are learning Self-Defense Against Fresh Fruit. Another one of the badges looks just like the logo for the Fireside Girls. And the badge shown with the animator credits is a sheet of paper punched for an animation disc ({==} O {==}). In the sequence where the house has just taken flight, it floats past the apartment of a little black girl; she has a not-so-Hidden Mickey in the form of her Minnie Mouse style hairdo (also known as afro puffs). Also, the ball she's playing with is the one from Luxo Jr and hidden in the lower left corner is a Lotso Huggin' bear. The Pizza Planet truck makes a cameo in the next scene. A Monty Python-esque frog wakes Carl up and gets smacked for its trouble.

However, the fictional elements of the film's origin story are made up for the film itself, and familiar folkloric elements are not depicted, or at least not in the usual way. The film connects Robin's origins with historical tensions between King John and his nobles. Hollywood History is rampant.The Third Crusade is over, and an archer of murky origins named Robin Longstride deserts the English army together with his friends. He comes across a dying knight who sets him off on a quest to discover the secrets of his past. Meanwhile, England is beset by troubles from within and without. A newly crowned king's incompetence proves taxing, the nobles are restive, the common people face impending poverty and hunger, and a traitor is working with foreign powers to cripple the kingdom. Robin's journey takes him to the English royal court and to the struggling town of Nottingham, where he finds his true heritage and true love, and rises at England's hour of need to burst into legend as &quot;Robin of the Hood&quot;.The usual storyline, about the nobleman Robin being outlawed, making trouble for the Sheriff of Nottingham, and Storming the Castle at the end to save Maid Marion (the one used by Douglas Fairbanks' silent Robin Hood, Errol Flynn's The Adventures of Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, Men in Tights, etc.) is hardly covered here &mdash; this film is more of an Origins Episode for that heroic outlaw.Unlike some other Robin Hoods and like one other (Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn's Robin and Marion, which featured Robin at the end of his career), the film is mostly set in the reign of King John and only features his brother Richard The Lionheart at the start. The film also includes more Historical Domain Characters than is usual for Robin Hood films. Aside from Kings Richard and John, their mother Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, John's wife Queen Isabella of Angoul&ecirc;me, the English court official William Marshal and King Philip Augustus of France all have roles in the plot.Like most previous Robin Hood films this film has its own beat and style. It is an Adaptation Distillation of centuries of oral and written tradition, and book, television and film treatments.

But he's forever pining for his childhood sweetheart Jenny (played by Hanna Hall and Robin Wright).Forrest's journey takes him from his native Alabama to the jungles of Vietnam, from walking in corrective leg-braces to running across North America, from misunderstood country boy to college football star to champion ping-pong player to shrimp tycoon, without ever quite losing the undying optimism of the era. On the other hand, Jenny's life takes her from a Catholic Schoolgirl to being in one of the early issues of Playboy, from a flower child of the '60s to a hippie protestor of the '70s.

Cobb's skills in understanding the human mind make him one of the world's best extractors, but his job has turned him into an international fugitive who can't return home to his family in the United States. When an attempt to extract information from a Japanese business magnate named Saito goes wrong, Cobb goes on the run from his current employers.Saito catches up with Cobb and makes the extractor an offer: he'll arrange to wipe Cobb's criminal record (which would allow him to go home) if Cobb can manage to perform an inception on one of Saito's rivals. Whereas extraction involves stealing ideas or information already in somebody's head, inception involves the insertion of an idea into someone's head in a way which convinces the target that they independently conceived the idea. Cobb accepts Saito's proposal, even though he knows it has a catch: nobody has ever pulled off a successful inception, as the targets always realize that they didn't come up with the inserted idea.To attempt the impossible, Cobb assembles a Badass Crew of experts: longtime extraction partner Arthur, dreamworld-building architect Ariadne, expert forger Eames, and chemist Yusuf (who devises the specialized sedatives that make extraction possible). The task requires them to perform a very risky &quot;dream within a dream within a dream&quot; scenario which will allow the team to bury the idea deep enough to leave no trace of their influence. As Cobb's group works their way into the target's mind, a complication Cobb failed to warn them about arises: inside the dream world, Cobb's subconscious demons makes for a worse enemy than their target's &mdash; and if they die in the dream, well, the sedatives assure that they simply don't wake up...", "name": "TVTItem"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/MindScrew", "comment": "The trailer made the movie look like a lot more of a Mind Screw than it actually was.", "name": "Mind Screw"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/LotusEaterMachine", "comment": "Lotus-Eater Machine: Yusuf runs one of these as a day job.

The various mob leaders become so afraid of Batman that when a scarred psychopath in clown makeup shows up and offers to kill Batman, they hire him...but once backed by the mob, said psychopath decides that simply killing Batman won't satisfy him. The Joker aims to destroy Gotham City from the inside out, and part of his &quot;plan&quot; involves attempts to corrupt the city's two heroes (Batman and Harvey Dent) by making their lives hell until they snap...The Dark Knight received a overwhelmingly positive critical reception as a serious drama (unique for a comic book movie) thanks in large part to the tour de force performances of its cast (including the late Heath Ledger's acclaimed performance as The Joker). The film holds the record for the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time in the United States (behind The Avengers, Titanic, and Avatar) and the twelfth-highest worldwide. It also became the first comic book film to win an acting Academy Award when Heath Ledger posthumously won Best Supporting Actor.The title of this film &mdash; The Dark Knight &mdash; marks the first time a Batman film has not featured the character's name in the title.Followed by the third and final part in the trilogy, The Dark Knight Rises.", "name": "TVTItem"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/MindRape", "comment": "Mind Rape: Of all the Joker's acts of callous villainy and casual disregard for human dignity, none is worse than his  turning of Harvey Dent into a vengeful monster by warping his mind during his vulnerable time of grief over Rachel's death.

In The Present Day Tommy Creo is an oncologist searching for a cure for his wife's brain cancer, and is obsessive in his pursuit to the point of leaving his wife to deal with her illness on her own most of the time. He stumbles across an extract from a South American tree that has promising results. Meanwhile, his wife comes to terms with her fate and is trying to finish a book which also happens to be about the second storyline.In the second storyline, Tom&aacute;s is a Spanish soldier during the Age of Exploration trying to defend his queen, Isabel, (again played by Weisz) from the Spanish Inquisition, when she sends him on a quest to South America where he is to find the Tree of Life.In the third storyline, Tom, &quot;the Astronaut,&quot; is a bald, monk-like man in a space bubble containing land and a tree. He is sustaining himself off of an extract of the tree but at the same time is rationing to avoid having the tree die. It seems he believes the tree holds some connection to his wife, who visits him in visions. We learn eventually that he is headed towards a star that his wife told him about in the present day timeline. He tattoos an elaborate pattern up his arm to mark the passage of time, like tree rings.In each of the three storylines, he is dedicated to his mission to the neglect of all other things. The relationships between the three storylines are up for debate as there seem to be indirect interactions between the three versions of Jackman's character that suggest that they might be the same person or that one or two of the characters might be imaginary to the third.The story explores the themes of mortality and the natural cycle of life as well as the stages of loss.If you're looking for a certain Ayn Rand book, that's here.", "name": "TVTItem"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/MindScrew", "comment": "Mind Screw: There are numerous ways of interpreting the relationships between the multiple timelines, and a few recurring plot elements blur the lines between them. A relatively straightforward explanation would be that  Future Tom is Present Day Tommy several hundred years in the future by way of the mystical life-prolonging plant, the tree in the spaceship formed from the seed that Tommy planted over Izzy's grave, and all scenes with Past Tommy are part of Izzy's book. On the other hand, it is equally straightforward to say that  Tommy finished the novel with the scenes in space, since by planting the tree he already accepted Izzy's death, though this depends on whether or not you believe Tommy was really at peace during his final scene, since the funeral scene has him insisting that he will refuse to accept death, and this would require him essentially reaching enlightenment in the fraction of seconds between the first and the last scene. Then you have present Tommy's wedding ring which Tomas got from Queen Isabella, which future-Tom plucks out of Tomas' hand after Tomas was bodily absorbed by the tree after Tommy lost it down the drain in the present. Once future-Tom attained enlightenment, he could apparently see all possible versions of his own story. Future Tom not only bodily intervenes in Izzy's story, he convinces present Tommy (via Mental Time Travel?) to change the present timeline to go for a walk with Iz at the very start of the film instead of staying in the lab, changing the plot.

Physical appearance of the baleful spirit closely resembles an onryo, a traditional Japanese type of ghost on which Wikipedia has more here.Also, some books on psychic phenomena mention a Japanese woman (first name Shizuko) who performed 'spirit photography' on stage in the early 20th century.The novel has been adapted to film three times in Japan, America, and Korea (In all three film adaptations the main character is changed from a man to a woman) with varying levels of success. The Korean film is the closest to the book. There was also a TV series, a radio drama, and a video game.Sequels and prequels to both the novel and movies exist, and follow wildly divergent continuities from one another.The novels: Ring Spiral Loop Birthday (Short story collection; including a prequel to Ring, a P.O.V.

It is based on real events - the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC during the Second Greco-Persian War, as described by the ancient Greek historian Herodotus. Miller was introduced to the Thermopylae story through a 1962 Sword And Sandal movie version called The 300 Spartans, which influenced him deeply as a child. The comic and film are extreme examples of historical movies being Very Loosely Based on a True Story, as artistic license is liberally employed, more so in the film.A young, one-eyed Spartan soldier relates to a group of soldiers how recent events came to pass. King Leonidas of Sparta (Gerard Butler) refuses to bow to the God King Xerxes' demands for Sparta to submit to the Persian Empire. A visit to the deformed, elderly Ephors and their Oracular Urchin/Sex Slave brings worse news: Sparta cannot wage war against the armies of Persia on the eve of the sacred Carneia festival.After much deliberation, Leonidas himself defies the oracles' prophecies; gathering three hundred of Sparta's finest soldiers and calling them his &quot;personal bodyguard&quot;, Leonidas plans to walk to the Hot Gates (Thermopylae), a narrow pass between the ocean and mountains. By rebuilding an ancient wall to bottleneck the vast Persian army, the superior fighting ability of the Spartans would conceivably make up for the small size of their army. Seven hundred or so other Greeks turn up as Leonidas and the 300 make their way to the Hot Gates, and a hideously deformed Spartan man called Ephialtes also joins the convoy to ask Leonidas for a place on the battlefield; in exchange, Ephialtes will give the king information about an unguarded path that would leave the Spartans wide open to retaliation from behind. Leonidas refuses to accept Ephialtes into the fighting ranks &mdash; it would leave a weak point in their defense &mdash; and returns his attention to preparing for the battle.When the Persian Army brings its forces down on the Hot Gates, the Spartans' plan works perfectly, and a lot of one-sided ass-kicking ensues.In the meantime, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) tries to persuade the Spartan politicians to support Leonidas, but Theron &mdash; scarily played by Dominic West &mdash; is the most stubborn of the lot.The battle goes exactly according to Leonidas' plan; the skill and perfect defensive position of the Spartans proves to be too much even for the monstrous Persian army. The kill count is obscenely lopsided, and the only real problem occurs when Ephialtes sells his information to Xerxes for women, wealth and a (horrible) uniform.300 is very stylized due to its comic book roots and also since it's presented as a morale-boosting story by Dilios. While accurate in some historical aspects (mostly quotes), it's presented first and foremost as a visual Greek epic tale of glory and death and how battling half naked is strategically superior. Trying to justify or explain it is as futile as explaining why Matrix should face court-martial for property damage.

In fact, historical records of the event are already believed to be rather sensationalized and greatly embellished. Zack Snyder and Frank Miller also drew inspiration from ancient artwork, which, much like Hollywood, glamorize battles of the past. Audiences have loved muscle-bound, half-naked supermen kicking the snot out of each other for a while. The embellishment is heavily implied as part of the Greek propaganda even during the film. On the other hand, Zack Snyder did state rather audaciously that the history presented in the film is &quot;90% accurate, although the visuals are pretty crazy&quot;. However, none of these explain a few details: The Spartan soldiers' disdain for the Ephors and the supernatural in general. Spartans were particularly religious for Ancient Greeks. The Spartan Ephors are transformed from the equivalent of five Senators who run Spartan government into deformed molester priests who betray their people. Sparta was run by two democratically elected &quot;kings&quot; who held equal power and were in turn judged by the ephors. Going to just one of them is pointless, and even if he did accede, he'd probably be branded a traitor and thrown out of the city immediately. Leonidas criticizes Athenians as &quot;boy-lovers.&quot; Spartans were even more committed to pederasty, the relationship between adult men and adolescent boys, than the other Greek city-states. note&nbsp; The relationship between adult men and adolescent boys was used like in all Greek states for education of the adolescent boy. However many Spartan sources, and even some outside of Sparta, insist that the relationship was not sexual in nature as that would have been similar to a father doing it with his son. The relationships were broken by the time the older man married as he would have to concentrate on his main job in peace: procreation. In Athens however the matter was completely different due to the locking up of women in gyneceums and their general lack of rights compared to Spartan women, the main sexual relationships of men were with other men. When it came to the relationship between adult men and adolescent boys it involved a lot of competition between the older men for the affections of the teens and the whole thing resembled soap operas with the older men serenading the boys writing them love poerm and stuff like that, something that would have ended with two beheaded bodies in Sparta. That might have been what Leonidas meant by &quot;boy lovers&quot;. Adultery was not shameful in Sparta. Slavery was outlawed in the Persian Empire, and Xerxes proclaiming himself a god would have been seen as heresy in the Zoroastrian religion he followed. The Spartans on the other hand, far from a rural, freedom-loving society, were a minority (almost a military kaste) who lived by continually and ruthlessly repressing the majority of the population, the helots. The latter were essentially slaves who worked the land to produce the food so that the former could spend all their time in oppressing them, and fighting other wars in between. During some periods, a Spartan could kill a Helot unpunished if he wanted. The historical Xerxes is depicted in ancient artwork as having a long beard and hair, wearing elaborate royal robes.

His jealous uncle Scar makes a power play for the throne, engineering the death of Simba's father and convincing Simba in his naivet&eacute; to accept culpability.Simba flees the Pride Lands in shame, but is saved from certain death in the wastelands by Timon and Pumbaa, two wisecracking animals who raise Simba under their responsibility-free philosophy of &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot; (&quot;no worries&quot;). However, when Simba meets an old friend from his past years later, he must decide whether to continue his carefree existence or return to the dying Pride Lands and reclaim his throne from Scar.A plot described by some as Hamlet and Macbeth, with a few hints of Henry IV, with Talking Animals. The sequels seem to follow the Shakespeare trend, as The Lion King II: Simba's Pride is Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth With Talking Animals In Africa, and The Lion King 1 &frac12; resembles Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead (a Perspective Flip of Hamlet, written in the 1960s). It launched the fantastic spinoff Timon &amp; Pumbaa, which is vastly different in tone and setting from the original movie. A second television series, The Lion Guard, is set to appear as part of the Disney Junior lineup in 2015, focused around Simba's son Kion, who gathers a group of animals to protect the Pride Lands from danger. (Kiara has been confirmed as turning up in the series, making the new series backstory to the DVD films.)Not only was the film a roaring financial success, it also garnered massive acclaim. In a recent poll, it was voted &quot;best animated movie of all time,&quot; even over older Walt Disney films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Bambi and Pinocchio. The film is generally considered to be not only one of the crown jewels of the Disney Renaissance, but a strong contender for the Magnum Opus of the Disney studios.The video game adaptation for the Genesis and SNES (and others) was very well received, though notoriously hard beyond the first level.The Screen-to-Stage Adaptation The Lion King arrived on Broadway in 1997 and it was an instant smash hit that received much acclaim for its imaginative staging, musical numbers and general awesomeness, by director Julie Taymor.Now has a re-release in Disney Digital 3D, which has become the first re-release of a movie since the 1997 re-release of Return of the Jedi to hit number one at the box office.One of the approximately 40 foreign dubs of this movie, incidentally, was in Zulu, and it remains the only Disney movie to ever have been dubbed in an African language.", "name": "TVTItem"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/MixAndMatchCritters", "comment": "Rafiki is a Mandrill with a tail of a Baboon and living in savannah instead of in the forest; Pumbaa is a reddish brown warthog that looks more like a big-headed pig than a warthog; Timon is an always-bipedal meerkat with human-like teeth and that says &quot;Ugh, Carnivores!&quot; even though he belongs to the order Carnivora as well; the Spotted Hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) that bear some resemblance with Striped Hyenas (Hyaena hyaena), with grey hair, large shaggy black manes, black ears and low-hanging head.", "name": "Mix-and-Match Critters"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/CoDragons", "comment": "Co-Dragons: Though Shenzi is the ringleader (as befitting their species), Banzai and Ed are her friends, and hence this.", "name": "Co-Dragons"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/BlowingARaspberry", "comment": "Blowing a Raspberry: Young Nala does this to Zazu behind his back during &quot;I Just Can't Wait to Be King.&quot;", "name": "Blowing a Raspberry"}, {"url": "http://dbtropes.org/resource/Main/AwardBaitSong", "comment": "Award Bait Song: &quot;Can You Feel The Love Tonight&quot;.
